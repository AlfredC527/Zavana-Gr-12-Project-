#Branawaan Software Development Project Kickstarter Paragraph

#In a duo with Alfred C, we intend to creative a web scraper tool 
#that gathers information from the website carpages.ca to deliver the user the cheapest minivan option the program finds. 
#We currently are interested in scraping information from carpages.ca, but we are interested in investigating 
#other used car websites such as autotrader.ca. 
#We are using the programming language Ruby.
